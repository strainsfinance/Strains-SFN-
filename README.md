- **Deflationary.** We burn 2.5% of every SFN transaction meaning our circulating supply is constantly decreasing.

- **Staking.** 3.5% of every transaction will go toward stake rewards. We want to encourage our users to hold their SFN so we have decided to build our reward mechanism right into the contract.

- **Interoperable.** Strains enables transactions across many chains.

- **Innovative.** Strains Smart NFT technology will allow meta data to be captured through every process of the CBD life cycle. The end user/purchase will receive a complete NFT with all of the details about their CBD.
